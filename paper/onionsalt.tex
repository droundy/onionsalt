\maketitle

Tarzan is a low-latency peer-to-peer anonymizing layer that acts at
the IP level~\cite{freedman2002tarzan}.  The second-generation Tor
router uses a telescaping connection-based encryption
scheme~\cite{dingledine2004tor} rather than the ``onion-based'' system
of the original onion routing~\cite{reed1998onionrouting}.  Note that
the latter paper (the old one) is actually a very nice
read~\cite{reed1998onionrouting}.  Aqua is an interesting and recent
high-bandwidth anonymizing network~\cite{leblond2013towards}.

Here is a nice paper to read on distributed hash tables and security
considerations involved~\cite{sit2002security}.  And here is a nice
one about how you need a critical mass in order to ensure
anonymity~\cite{dingledine2006anonymity}.
